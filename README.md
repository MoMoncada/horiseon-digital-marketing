# Horiseon Digital Marketing: Code Refactor


## Description

Web accessibility is important to enhance the perception, understanding and interaction with a web page. 

There are different reasons of why this is vital to the user's experience like the possibility of the user being a person with disabilities or to have a better position in search engines. 

In this challenge, we have refactor the code to meet web accessibility standarts by improving the provided code. Giving it a semantic HTML structure and concise, but comprehensive, CSS rules.

The document has been reviwed to ensure the functionality of the web page has not changed, except for the 'Search Engine Optimization' link which was corrected during the refactor process.
